Lowercase letters represent operand values (actual values are to be substituted). Underlined operands represent the default values (i.e., the value used when the operand is omitted). The first operand (hexloc1) specifies the address of the first byte whose contents are to be displayed. The address may be one to six hexadecimal digits (0–9, A–F) in length. If it is not specified, the address 0 is assumed. The address must be within the actual memory range of the machine. The second operand specifies the amount of memory to be displayed. If hexloc2 is specified, it defines the address of the last byte in the range of locations to be displayed. It may be one to six hexadecimal digits in length. The address must be greater than or equal to the starting address (hexloc1). Also, hexloc2 must be within the actual memory range of the machine. If END is specified, memory is displayed up through the last actual byte in the machine. If bytecount is specified, it defines the number of bytes of memory to be displayed (starting with the location specified in hexloc1).
